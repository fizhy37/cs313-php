			<p id="about_me" class="about">My name is Ben Fisher. I'm a freelance videographer from Pocatello, Idaho, but I live in Rexburg now. I have a drone license. I've been into video production for over 10 years now. You might wonder why I'm a computer science major then. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why, but it felt like the thing to do. Computers have always interested me, and I like to build things. So I figured I could try it out. So far it's been pretty challenging, but I also like it.<br><br>

			After I graduated from high school, I served a mission in Malaga Spain (the best mission in the world). I met a sister missionary there who was from Idaho Falls. I wrote her after I got home, and when she got home we started dating. We have been married for 10 months now.</p>

			<p id="about_fdm" class="about">Being that I love making videos, I started a little side business. It's called Fisher Digital Media. Most of my work has been making wedding videos, but I also have made commercials and similar promotional videos for people. I feel like I know my way around the Adobe video editing software like Premiere Pro and After Effects, yet I still learn something new about each one every day.<br><br>

			I started back around middle school with a video camera. My friend and I would play around with it and make stupid little videos. Before long, I started playing around with editing the videos, and around that time, YouTube was starting to be a thing. So we started making content for that. Looking back, I am almost embarassed by the videos that we made, but it was an essential learning time to get where I am today. We took a classes in high school with some more friends and became known in our school as the video guys.<br><br>

			I feel rewarded when I see the final product of a project that I have worked on. Seeing people's reactions is also a huge rush. That's kind of what keeps me going in the business, because the money part just wouldn't be enough.<br><br>

			I included two links at the top of this page. FDM Website is for Fisher Digital Media. It's a mock website I created but haven't officially launched yet. On there I have a portfolio if you have any interest in seeing what I've done. I also included a link to our YouTube channel that we uploaded videos to throughout high school. Feel free to poke around.</p>
